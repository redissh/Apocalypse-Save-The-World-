### Backstory

<p align="left"><font size="3"> This is the first game i ever made, i made it 5 years ago for a school project in Scratch.
  It's extremely buggy and i never got to finish it but it's still one of my favourite projects as it reminds me 
  of which lows i come from so i thought i might share this with the 
  world to remind everyone we all start from something and to never give up!</font></p>
  
<p align="left"><font size="1"> PS. I shared the <p onclick="source.href='Apocalypse - 2D PvE Shooter.sb3'"></p> save files for anyone interested
